### Installation:
The Code is written in Python 3.7.3 If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

##### 1. First create a virtual environment by using this command:
```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.7
```
##### 2. Activate the environment using the below command:
```bash
conda activate myenv
```
##### 3. Then install all the packages by using the following command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##### 4. Then, in cmd or Anaconda prompt write the following code:
```bash
python app.py
```

##### Make sure to change the directory to the root folder. The folder structure should be same as of this repository otherwise it will throw error.
